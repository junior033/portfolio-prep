1. Code Voyager

2. Military Veteran with proven experience in building exceptional relationships with high-level initiative, attention to detail, commitment to excellence, and growth. Proven performance in linking corporate vision with the delivery of desired results through empowerment, development, and utilization of people, processes, and technology.

3. I’m currently studying Computer Science at FIU. One of my greatest strengths is my ability problem solve and my curiosity. I'm always trying to find different and improve the solutions to problems we face. When I finished high school I immediately sought employment in a field where I can help people because it has always been a passion of mine to try to seek a way to improve the lives of others so I studied to be a personal trainer and received my certification and started right away working across a few gyms over a few years before I decided I wanted to serve a greater purpose and gain a more worldly perspective by joining the military. I enlisted in the Military at age 22 and served approximately 5 years as an administrative specialist serving many different platforms from Directors, CO's (CEO), and Department Heads. It was during my time in the military, spending time overseas, and helping underprivileged communities that I began to develop an interest in helping businesses connect with their customers. I saw that it was a very fundamental way of life for so many families to have a business of their own and be able to serve their communities in order to bring food to their tables. I was fortunate to learn what it means to be an efficient, dependable, and tenacious individual that always strived to not only accomplish the task at hand but also to dig deeper and find solutions to problems in hopes of improving the process. When I left the military It was because I wanted to learn how to better solve problems and use this skill to better businesses achieve a higher standard of service for their customers. I decided that learning Computer Science and furthermore learning software development was a way I could bring this passion to fruition.
 
4. I’m looking for an environment where I further cultivate my expertise in this field because my ultimate aim is to help organizations develop better products and services for their customers. I'm passionate about helping people and developing technology that can help us provide a better life for communities around the world. I aim to do this by bringing my skills in problem-solving, process improvement, and leadership to software development.
